# Part 1: Supervised Contrastive Learning
Supervised Learning is a machine learning tenet that uses labeled data (x->y) to train a model to make inferences. Contrastive Learning on the other hand, can utilize both labeled and non-labeled data. However, incorporating labels into the data while applying contrastive learning can enhance the models' performance.

In this section, supervised contrastive learning is applied on a CV classification task, and compared to a model that does not.
