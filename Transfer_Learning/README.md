# Transfer Learning in NLP

There are three big benefits to transfer learning in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence: efficiency, performance, and flexibility. It is efficient because it allows the knowledge from a pre-trained model to be transferred onto a new, different model. It also can drastically improve performance on a new task as it incorporates more data, and is flexible as it can be applied on a variety of tasks and models.

In this section, transfer learning is applied onto a natural language processing question-answering task.
