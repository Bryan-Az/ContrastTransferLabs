# Part 3: Zeroshot Transfer Learning on CV
 Transfer learning is demonstrated using the zeroshot technique - which seeks to improve model performance by generalizing its' knowledge on variations of unstructured and non-labeled data that was not given to the model during training. 

 In this section, zeroshot transfer learning is applied onto a computer vision classification task with the CLIP model.
